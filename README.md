This code realises several aloritms of working with database on sql. 
# Algoritms:
1. Implement a stored function/procedure that returns the total number of balances of a given product name in stores and warehouses.
2. Implement a stored function/procedure that displays a message by the name of the product and the age of the buyer about the possibility of purchasing this product by this buyer.
3. Implement a stored function/procedure that evaluates the possibility of purchasing a given quantity of goods in a store (the name of the store and the product are set by the user). At the same time, it is also necessary to check the age restrictions of the buyer (using the function from paragraph 2).
